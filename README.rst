SheetSync
=========

|Build Status|

A python3 compatible fork of `mbrenig/SheetSync <https://github.com/mbrenig/SheetSync>`_.

A python library to create, update and delete rows of data in a google spreadsheet. `Click here to read the full documentation <http://sheetsync.readthedocs.org/>`_.

Installation
------------
Install from PyPi using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_::

  pip install sheetsync3

Or you can clone the git repo and install from the code::

  git clone git@github.com:samdfonseca/sheetsync.git sheetsync3
  pip install sheetsync3

Note, you may need to run the commands above with ``sudo``.

Setting up OAuth 2.0 access
---------------------------
The Google Drive API now requires the use of OAuth2.0. This means you will need
to go through a bit of configuration to get an API Client ID and Client Secret
before using sheetsync.

Read the step-by-step `getting started guide <http://sheetsync.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_ for instructions.

Injecting data to a Google sheet
--------------------------------
SheetSync works with data in a dictionary of dictionaries. Each row is
represented by a dictionary, and these are themselves stored in a dictionary
indexed by a row-specific key. For example this dictionary represents two rows
of data each with columns "Color" and "Performer":

.. code-block:: python

   data = { "Kermit": {"Color" : "Green", "Performer" : "Jim Henson"},
            "Miss Piggy" : {"Color" : "Pink", "Performer" : "Frank Oz"}
           }

To insert this data (add or update rows) into a target
worksheet in a google spreadsheet doc use this code:

.. code-block:: python

   import logging
   from sheetsync import Sheet, ia_credentials_helper
   # Turn on logging so you can see what sheetsync is doing.
   logging.getLogger('sheetsync').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   logging.basicConfig()

   # Create OAuth2 credentials, or reload them from a local cache file.
   CLIENT_ID = '171566521677-3ppd15g5u4lv93van0eri4tbk4fmaq2c.apps.googleusercontent.com'
   CLIENT_SECRET = 'QJN*****************hk-i'
   creds = ia_credentials_helper(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, 
                                 credentials_cache_file='cred_cache.json')

   data = { "Kermit": {"Color" : "Green", "Performer" : "Jim Henson"},
            "Miss Piggy" : {"Color" : "Pink", "Performer" : "Frank Oz"} }

   # Find or create a spreadsheet, then inject data.
   target = Sheet(credentials=creds, document_name="sheetsync Getting Started")
   target.inject(data)
   print("Spreadsheet created here: {}".format(target.document_href))

The first part of this script imports the ``Sheet`` object and
``ia_credentials_helper`` function. This function is included to help you quickly
generate an `OAuth2Credentials <https://google-api-python-client.googlecode.com/hg/docs/epy/oauth2client.client.OAuth2Credentials-class.html>`_ object using your Client ID and Secret.

The second part creates a new spreadsheet document in your google drive and then inserts the data like so:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbrenig/SheetSync/master/docs/Sheet1.png

Later on you'll probably want to access this data, to do that note the
spreadsheet's document key from the URL:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbrenig/SheetSync/master/docs/URL.png

and access the data as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    source = Sheet(credentials=creds,
                   document_key="1bnieREGAyXZ2TnhXgYrIacCIY09Q2lfGXNZbjsvJ82M",
                   worksheet_name='Sheet1')
    print source.data()

The 'inject' method only adds or updates rows. If you want to delete rows from the spreadsheet to keep it in sync with the input data then use the 'sync' method.

Full documentation
------------------
Is available `here <http://sheetsync.readthedocs.org/>`_.

Testing and development
-----------------------
SheetSync comes with tox tests. To run them, you'll need to copy the .secret
file to .mysecrets and fill in your own Client ID, Secret and Testdoc folder
key. Then run with the following two commands::

    . .mysecrets
    tox
